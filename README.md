- Invite your employees, collegues and/or firends

- Create different types of questions: **open questions**, **multiple choice** or **votes**

- give all members of the GameRoom the option to create and aks questions

- create regular challanges

- Set the time when the question goes live and when it ends every day

- analyse the results. (for example: what are you employees thinking, how can you improve the motivation or the business, who knows the most)
